This wrapper is a fork of banthar's Go-SDL. It adds a lot of missing functions, plus a port of pygame's transform package.

Make sure you have SDL, SDL_image, SDL_mixer, and SDL_ttf.

If the bindings fail to compile, run 'hg pull -u' in $GOROOT and rebuild Go.

Music to test SDL_mixer is by Kevin MacLeod.
