* Windows support. Since Go supports GUI applications now, this should be possible.
* Mac support. Go-SDL has been reported to work with X11 video driver (SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11). Default (Quartz) driver doesn't work.
* missing functions, threads and file access are useless in Go, but there are probably some usefull functions left
* add joystick support
* other SDL libraries: SGE, gfx ...
* more/better test/example apps
* Add real ColorModel support to Surfaces.
